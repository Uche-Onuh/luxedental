                <div class="answer">
                    <p>To help ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy, we recommend that most people come in for a check every 
                        six – 12 months. This check usually forms part of your hygiene appointment but can also be done separately 
                        if you prefer.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Like adults, a dental check-up every six – 12 months is recommended for children in order to ensure that their 
                    teeth and gums remain healthy. This frequency could change depending on the current state of your child’s oral 
                    health or if they are undergoing any dental treatment.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes. Fluoride is a natural mineral which can be found in air, rock, soil, water. It is commonly found in toothpastes 
                    and in teeth-cleaning gels because it helps to prevent and repair any damage caused by acid on the surface of the 
                    tooth and protects against tooth decay. The use of fluoride has been a major factor in the significant decreased 
                    incidence of dental decay and tooth loss in Australia since its introduction in the 1950’s.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>What is the difference between dental floss and dental tape?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>While dental floss and dental tape are certainly very similar, they do have their important differences. 
                    Dental tape is essentially a wide, flat ribbon made from nylon and comes in waxed or unwaxed varieties. 
                    Dental tape is a great way to introduce yourself to the action and routine of regular flossing. As it is 
                    in thinner than traditional floss, people generally find it easier to get in between those small, hard to 
                    reach spaces in between our teeth.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="pair">
            <div class="question">
                <p>What type of dental floss will be most effective for me?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If you’ve ever been to a supermarket and felt a little overwhelmed looking at all the different types of 
                    dental floss, then you are not alone. To help you cut through the clever marketing, it’s important to remember 
                    that there are generally only two main types of floss – multifilament (also known as nylon or silk floss) and 
                    monofilament (made from a type of rubber or plastic). Of these two types, nylon floss is the most common and 
                    traditional type that you will most likely come across at your local dentist, while monofilament floss is a 
                    more modern invention. Unlike nylon floss, monofilament floss doesn’t rip or tear and as such, you may find 
                    that it glides easier between your teeth. If mint doesn’t appeal to you, floss can come in a range of different 
                    and interesting flavours and thicknesses. The thickness of the floss is quite important and a personal choice 
                    depending on the spacing of your teeth and what is most comfortable for you. You may also come across the terms, 
                    ‘waxed’ or ‘unwaxed’ when searching for the best floss for you. Monofilament flosses do not need wax, while 
                    traditional nylon floss uses it to help the floss glide in and out of the spaces between your teeth with ease. 
                    At the end of the day, it really does come down to a personal preference as to what dental floss you use but 
                    ultimately, the best type of floss is always the type that is being used.</p>

                <p>How many teeth can be replaced with dental implants?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>You can replace a single tooth, multiple teeth or all your teeth with implants. 
                    You don't even need one implant for every missing tooth. As few as two Implants can support a 
                    removable lower denture, while as few as four implants can provide a full, permanent set of top or bottom 
                    teeth.</p>

                <p>Is dental implant surgery painful?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Most people find dental implant surgery very easy to tolerate. Any post-operative discomfort can usually be 
                    managed with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or OTC pain-relievers. Ice can 
                    also be helpful.</p>

                <p>Are dental implants expensive?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>At the outset, implants are more expensive than other tooth-replacement methods such as dentures or 
                    bridgework. But they also last many years longer and in fact should never need replacement. So they 
                    offer the best, most cost-effective option when viewed as a long-term investment in your health, 
                    comfort and well-being.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>How do you care for dental implants?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>They require exactly the same care as natural teeth: daily brushing and flossing, along with regular 
                    dental checkups and professional cleanings. Although implant teeth will never decay, the gum tissues 
                    around them can become inflamed or infected in the absence of good oral hygiene. Properly cared-for 
                    dental implants should last a lifetime.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>Can my body reject a dental implant?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Strictly speaking, dental implants can't be rejected because they contain no living cells or genetically coded 
                    material. The titanium of which they are made is completely biocompatible, and allergies are extremely 
                    rare. But an implant can fail to integrate with the jawbone if an infection develops in the absence of 
                    good oral hygiene, or if it is subjected to biting forces too soon. However, this is rare; implants regularly 
                    achieve success rates in excess of 95%..</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Cavities can cause toothaches and sensitivity, but they can also lead to infection, which can cause more painful 
                    and complicated oral problems. When a patient experiences a toothache or sensitivity in the tooth, they should 
                    get the tooth checked out immediately to prevent further problems.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>Can a restorative dentist repair a broken tooth?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The answer to this question depends on the cause of the break. If the tooth is broken because of decay, the 
                    patient will be at risk of losing the tooth if the decay has spread and been left untreated for some time. 
                    The dentist will try to save the tooth with a root canal, which involves cleaning out the tooth and removing 
                    the pulp. If the tooth can be saved, the dentist will cover it up with a dental crown, protecting the remaining 
                    tooth from further damage and possible infection. If the decay has gone too far, the dentist will extract the 
                    remaining tooth. If the tooth was broken from an accident or while eating, the dentist will likely be able to 
                    save the tooth and protect it with a dental crown.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Dentists always tell their patients they are better off with their natural teeth as opposed to artificial 
                    teeth because no matter how advanced technology gets, there is no substitute for the real thing. Having 
                    teeth extracted can cause problems like the bone density loss in the jaw, which affects the patient’s appearance 
                    and eventually makes them appear older than they really are.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Restorative dentistry can be used to treat patients with missing teeth using several tools. The missing teeth can 
                    be replaced with dental crowns, dentures, dental bridges and dental implants. Dentures are the cheapest treatment 
                    option, but they are not as durable as the others. Dental crowns can be used to replace the missing teeth by 
                    attaching artificial teeth to two dental crowns that are cemented on the two adjacent teeth to the gap. Dental 
                    implants require surgery, but they are the most durable and natural looking replacements.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes, a chipped tooth can be saved using dental crowns, bonding or dental veneers. Bonding involves applying a 
                    tooth-colored composite resin material to the surface of the teeth and molding it to look like natural teeth. 
                    Dental veneers are wafer-thin porcelain shells that are bonded on the surface of the teeth to hide flaws like 
                    chipped teeth.

                <p> What causes the discoloration of a tooth?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Tooth discoloration is a normal part of aging. As people age, enamel wears down, and teeth take on a duller 
                    appearance. Teeth can also become discolored from smoking and heavy consumption of coffee or tea. Other causes 
                    of tooth discoloration include side effects of medications (specifically certain antibiotics) used during the 
                    developmental phase of the teeth, an individual’s genetic makeup, and excessive fluoride consumption (fluorosis, 
                    seen in both children and adults). Teeth whitening and veneers offer an aesthetic solution for people with 
                    discolored or dull-looking teeth.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Dentists take protective measures to prevent discomfort during teeth whitening procedures. 
                    Typically, a protective gel or rubber shield is used to prevent bleaching agents from damaging gum tissue. 
                    The most common bleaching agents used by dentists are approved, ensuring safety and effectiveness. After the 
                    whitening procedure, you may experience minimal tooth sensitivity for a short period of time.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>No. In cases involving severe discoloration, teeth whitening may not result in a bright, white smile. 
                    Individuals with severe tooth discoloration should consider other options, such as porcelain veneers 
                    or composite bonding.</p>

                <p>Although dentures are not considered a cosmetic procedure, they provide an aesthetic benefit for people 
                    who have lost all or some of their teeth. People who are missing only certain teeth, or rows of teeth, 
                    may be better served by a dental bridge or dental implants. It is best to have your situation evaluated 
                    by a dental professional in order to establish candidacy for any of these procedures.

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Smoking is a leading cause of tooth loss. Smokers also have an increased risk for periodontal disease

                    lung, throat, or oral cancer. Smokers therefore face an additional set of considerations when exploring cosmetic 
                    treatment. One restriction for smokers involves dental implants. Smoking increases the risk that a dental 
                    implant will fail to integrate with bone tissue (osseointegration). Smoking also affects gum health, and 
                    unhealthy gums can lead to dental implant failure. If you smoke, you need to quit before having an implant. 
                    Another restriction involves teeth whitening. If you whiten your teeth but continue to smoke, the whitening 
                    effect will not last as long, because smoking stains the teeth.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>Are dental implants suitable for children?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Dentists indicate that implants cannot be considered until bone growth has completed. This typically occurs 
                    during adolescence, but may vary from one child to the next. Implants placed prior to bone growth completion 
                    may shift out of place and cause severe problems. If a child loses a tooth before bone growth has completed, 
                    an orthodontic device called a “space maintainer” may be used to prevent an abnormal growth of surrounding 
                    teeth. Once bone growth has completed, the space maintainer can be removed and the missing tooth restored 
                    using an implant or bridge.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If you want to improve the look and feel of your smile, then any age can be a great age to see the orthodontist. 
                    We recommend that children first visit an orthodontist around the age of seven; however, orthodontic treatment 
                    is not exclusive to children and teens, with about one in every four orthodontic patients being over the age of 
                    21. Whether you're considering treatment for yourself or for a child, any time is a good time to visit the 
                    orthodontist.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes. Some orthodontic problems are significant enough to require early intervention. However, 
                    if a patient is not yet ready for treatment, we will follow that patient’s growth and development 
                    until the time is right for treatment to begin.

                    make a proper diagnosis. The doctor will then complete a brief, but thorough, exam. If you are ready we would

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Treatment time obviously depends on each patient’s specific orthodontic needs. In general, treatment time lasts 
                    from 6 months to 30 months and varies based on individual treatment complexity, needs, and personal treatment 
                    goals.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Orthodontic treatment has come a long way in recent years. New technology allows us to use lighter forces to move 
                    the teeth over a much shorter amount of time. You can expect the braces to make your teeth sore for a few days 
                    after they are placed and after each adjustment. These adjustments will make you more conscious of your teeth, 
                    but they should not be painful. This annoyance can be relieved with an over-the-counter pain reliever (use as 
                    directed). Today’s braces are smaller, more comfortable and use technology that reduces the discomfort. We use 
                    the latest in technology in order to reduce discomfort and treatment time.</p>
